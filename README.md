# Overview
This project is a budget planner which shows where money is being spent in the form of a doughnut chart. Data is coming from a firestore database, and new data items can be added by filling out the form. The user can hover over each field within the doughnut chart to see more information and to delete an item, the user can click on the field to be deleted.

This is essentially the same as what is in Net Ninja's Udemy course "Build Data Vizualisations with D3.js & Firebase", though the design is somewhat different in this repo.

There are no dependencies in this project, so it can be run with the Live Server extension in VS Code.
